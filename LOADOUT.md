## Attachments

Attachments are organized into three groups and stored by the `SerialId` property in the actor class. The ID you need to use in the loadout manager is dependent on which attachments you have loaded. If the class can't be found or the weapon is incompatible, no attachment will be set.

* `ba`: ID for barrel attachment
* `bs`: ID for scope attachment
* `bm`: ID for misc attachment

### SerialID's

The ID's here I placed for convenience so you don't have to dive in the example code to find them.
